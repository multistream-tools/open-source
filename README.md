# Multistream Tools open source components

Open source [Multistream Tools](https://multistream.tools) **adapters**, **overlays**, **themes**, ...

## Notes

The code provided under the _src_ directory has been **extracted** from our closed source codebase which is a [factory project](https://github.com/multistream-tools/factory).

It is meant to be used as real world **examples** for building [adapters](https://multistream.tools/documentation/adapters/), [overlays](https://multistream.tools/documentation/overlays/), [themes](https://multistream.tools/documentation/themes/), ... and you can also **help** to improve it by submitting issues and pull requests (thanks!).

If you want to run it inside your own factory project, know that you would have to **update** _adapters.js_, _overlay.js_, _core.css_, _overlay.css_ and _dock.css_ relative paths (prefixed by _../../_) to full remote ones (prefixed by _https://obs.multistream.tools/v1/_).

That's it!
